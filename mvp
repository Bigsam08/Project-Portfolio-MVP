BUILD YOUR PORTFOLIO PROJECT (WEEK 2)
MVP COMPLETE.
PROJECT: ONLINE MOVIE VOTING WEBSITE:
Overview:
This is a website where users get to create account and login with authentication, having 
access to the website’s latest and trending movies where users can get to rate movies for 
other movie users to watch, saving movie lovers from wasting time watching irrelevant new 
release movies.
PROGRESS:
• I would rate the progress this week a 7/10.
• Project assessment this from this week’s progress lies on the fact that our 
website is now running on flask, a python development backend module to 
authenticate logins and registrations.
- Also, our user interface has been updated and made more beautiful and 
attritive for users to always come by.
- Movie categories also have been updated on the platform.
- Our website is fully responsive and can be accessed by any device, laptops, 
tabs, mobile phones and e.t.c.
• PARTS COMPLETED includes, the login page, registration page and also the 
main page, connection to backend technology.
• PARTS NOT COMPLETED:
- DATABASE, to fully connect to our database server.
- MOVIES for users to rate and a voting bar showing the most 
recommended movie in each category.
CHALLENGES:
• THE MOST CHALLENGING TECHHNOLOGY this second week has to do with 
connecting with MySQL database, the database exist but my flask app is 
struggling to connect with it despite the fact that have configured it to connect, 
it’s showing an error I need to bind to my database, am struggling finding a way 
around it though its causing a slow in pace to my project completion.
• NON-TECHNICAL CHALLENGE:
Well I wouldn’t know what to say at this time, maybe the fact that am doing the 
full stack all alone and there is nobody am sharing minds of same project with. I 
embrace the fact that am working alone despite its challenges, am learning 
more by the day on this project.BUILD YOUR PORTFOLIO PROJECT (WEEK 2)
